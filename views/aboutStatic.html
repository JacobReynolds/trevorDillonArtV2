<p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Hi! Iâ€™m a 21 year old artist, musician, and motorcycle enthusiast. I started my apprenticeship in 2013 at Brass Knuckle Tattoo Studio in Uptown Minneapolis. I enjoy doing all styles and sizes of tattoos but prefer medium to large color tattoos in illustrative, neo-traditional, traditional, and new school styles. I love tattooing nature, animals, water, and traditional imagery in my style.</p><p><br></p><p>To contact me for a tattoo you can email me&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8080/contact" data-mce-href="contact">here</a>&nbsp;for a consultation, call the shop at (612) 871-4249 for a consultation, or come into the shop with a $40 deposit to hold an appointment. Thank you for looking!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
