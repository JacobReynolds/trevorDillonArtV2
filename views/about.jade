            |Hi! Iâ€™m a 21 year old artist, musician, and motorcycle enthusiast. I started my apprenticeship in 2013 at Brass Knuckle Tattoo Studio in Uptown Minneapolis. I enjoy doing all styles and sizes of tattoos but prefer medium to large color tattoos in illustrative, neo-traditional, traditional, and new school styles. I love tattooing nature, animals, water, and traditional imagery in my style.
